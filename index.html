    <h3> About Me</h3>
    <p>
I am an international student originally from Lahore, Pakistan. It gets really hot there in the summer, temperatures could reach upto 115 F.
I am currently a rising sophomore at Bard trying to major in Computer Science. I'm involved in various activities and clubs on campus.
I am involved in the Bard Bollywood club, Bard Hookah Club, the ISO(International Student Organization), the MSO(Muslim Student Organization),
the Ping Pong club, and I'm also the PC of Keen North.

<h3>Coding and me.</h3>
I have taken two coding classes up untill now: Object Oriented Programming, and Data Structures. I love coding because it gives me
a chance to make something, or contribute to a project that could actually make a difference in the world. Next semester I am taking
Mobile Development which is my first 300 class at Bard(yay?).
